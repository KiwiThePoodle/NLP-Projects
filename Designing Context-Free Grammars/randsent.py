# Want to know what command-line arguments a program allows?
# Commonly you can ask by passing it the --help option, like this:
#     python randsent.py --help
# This is possible for any program that processes its command-line
# arguments using the argparse module, as we do below.
#
# NOTE: When you use the Python argparse module, parse_args() is the
# traditional name for the function that you create to analyze the
# command line.  Parsing the command line is different from parsing a
# natural-language sentence.  It's easier.  But in both cases,
# "parsing" a string means identifying the elements of the string and
# the roles they play.
